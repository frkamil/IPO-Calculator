      A wage is payment made by an employer to an employee (that's you) for work
      done in a specific time period.
    </p>
    <p>
      This simple wage calulator calculates the amount of money that your
      employer will pay you, based on the numbers of regular hours and overtime
      hours you have worked and how much you get paid for every hour you work.
